# How to Contribute

This is a very loose project, no big deal, all good. It's amazing that you want to contribute, but it would be nice if a few rules were followed:

## Issues

- So far, "we" are literally one person that's trying to make this work. Be patient and respectful.

## PRs

- When opening a PR, think twice when naming it, so it looks crispy and explanatory.
- When describing the PR, "title says it all" does not cut. Do it well, add information that we don't have in the code, write your literary magnum opus.
- Follow the coding convention â€” that's why there's `eslint` and `editorconfig` and all of that.
- The only reason there are two `@ts-ignore` in the codebase is: I don't know how to make TS work with Playwright, Node, `document`, and `window`. It's not because *I am* stupid that other people can throw `@ts-ignore` around.

## Extra

Respect everyone: whenever you are writing something, think Grandma will read it. Would she be happy with you calling someone's code "the worse code I've ever seen"? I don't think so. My Grandma would punch me, for sure.
